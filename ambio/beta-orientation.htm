<h1>Beta Test Orientation</h1>
<p>
    Ok everyone, this is it! The beta is ready and available now for download. I know you're anxious, but please allow me a few more minutes of your time and read this orientation <em>carefully</em> all the way to the end.
</p>

<h2>Good News, Bad News</h2>
<p>
    The good news: there's over 30 of you participating in the beta! The bad news: I originally  calculated there would be around 20 of you. This is a good problem. But I do ask that you be patient when submitting bugs or questions, we'll get back to you as soon as we can!
</p>
<p>
    The good news: there's lots of content for you to experiment with during the beta. The bad news: there's still a lot of content we haven't ported from Lightning Bug. So we might be missing some of your favorite sounds. But we'll be adding more content as the beta goes on and hope to have most of Lightning Bug's content ported over the coming weeks. I'll keep you posted on content updates via the Google+ group.
</p>
<p>
    The good news: Ambio is compatible with over 3000 different Android models. The bad news: we've raised the minimum Android requirement to 2.3 Gingerbread. Lightning Bug had support all the way back to 1.6 Donut.
</p>
<p>
    <em>If your device runs anything older than Android 2.3 Gingerbread, you unfortunately won't be able to install the beta.</em>
</p>
<p>
    We may backport Ambio in the future, but for now the best we can do is 2.3.
</p>

<h2>Device Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Android 2.3 Gingerbread or Higher</li>
<li>At least 12 MB of available internal storage space</li>
<li>Around 50 MB of available space on your SD card (or other external storage)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    *50 MB should accommodate most of the content currently available for download. So you don't actually need that much to install the beta. But if you do keep a lot of media on your Android device, such as music and video files, I personally recommend you regularly check your SD card and make sure you have at least 50 - 100 MB available. Weather you use Ambio or not, maintaining some free space on your SD card is a useful maintenance task for many of the same reasons it's useful on a Windows or Apple computer.
</p>

<h2>Premium Content & Advertising</h2>
<p>
    Like Lightning Bug, Ambio has both free and pay content. Unlike Lightning Bug, Ambio hosts advertising banners in some of its screens. Ambio also includes a few premium features available by purchasing an upgrade called Ambio+. All the pay content and Ambio+ are available via In-App purchase.
</p>
<p>
    As a part of being an Ambio beta tester, any in-app purchases you make in Ambio should be <em>100% free</em>. If you think you've been charged for a purchase, forward your receipt to <a href="mailto:support@happyexabytes.com">support@happyexabytes.com</a> and I'll look into it immediately.
</p>
<p>
    These zero-charge purchases will only be available while you are using the beta version of Ambio. If and when you upgrade to the official Google Play version of Ambio 1.0 you will be charged normally. This isn't up to me unfortunately, this is just how Google has set up the Play store and its beta testing functions.
</p>

<h2>Why are we Beta Testing?</h2>
<p>
    Generally a beta test is used to test a "releasable" version of an application. To put it another way, the version of Ambio you are about to install is a version that the team and I believe is good enough to be a 1.0. 
</p>
<p>
    Your duties as a beta tester are critical!
</p>
<p>
    What we are asking from you is to make sure that this version of Ambio is, in fact, worthy of being released to the hundreds of millions of users accessing the Play store. This means, more than anything else, we need your help locating <em>bugs</em> and <em>usability issues</em>:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>Bugs</em> are cases where the app either crashes or does not produce the results that you expect. For example: You press the Play button, but no sound comes out.</li>
    <li><em>Usability Issues</em> are cases where it is unclear to you how to perform a specific task. For example: You're looking at the player screen, but it's confusing and you can't figure out how to play sounds.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    You may have noticed that I didn't mention feature and content suggestions. Suggestions are a bit of a grey area. There are no stupid questions, there are also no stupid suggestions. But there <em>are</em> suggestions that may not be a good fit for our current release. There's also suggestions that maybe we haven't thought of and are totally crucial! Who knows :)
</p>
<p>
    For now we ask that you focus on bugs and usability issues, but always feel free to submit ideas and suggestions to our new uservoice site here:
</p>
<blockquote><a href="http://ambio.uservoice.com/">http://ambio.uservoice.com/</a></blockquote>

<h2>What should you test?</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mixes</strong> - Mixes take the place of 'scenes' in Lightning Bug. Please create lots of mixes! And please download as many of the available DLC (Downloadable Content) mixes as you can.</li>
    <li><strong>Playlists</strong> - Playlists are a new feature in Ambio. We expect there may be a bit of a learning curve with playlists, so please be patient with this feature and always feel free to ask questions.</li>
    <li><strong>Alarms</strong> - Like everything else, the alarm system has been completely re-written. It also supports selecting Mixes and Playlists in place of traditional alarm tones. We've tested the new alarm system <em>a lot</em>, but please test this extensively! If you want to use Ambio's alarm to wake you up for work, school, or anything else important, please also set a backup alarm using another app. </li>
</ul>


<h2>How do you report issues?</h2>
<h3>Bugs and Usability Issues</h3>
<p>
    The best way to report bugs is to use the Support option from Ambio's main menu. If the app has become unusable though, you can also just write to <a href="mailto:support@happyexabytes.com">support@happyexabytes.com</a> … it all goes to the same place.
</p>

<p>
When you report a bug, it's very important that you give us as much detail as you can so that we can reproduce your problem on our end. Include things like: what buttons you pressed, what screen you were on, what screens you were on previously, how long had the app been running, was there sound playing, etc. Anything and everything you can tell us!
</p>

<h3>General Questions</h3>
<p>
    You can always write us at the support email, and you can also ask questions in the Google+ group, but for general questions consider posting here:
</p>
<blockquote><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ambio-user-forum">http://groups.google.com/group/ambio-user-forum</a></blockquote>
<p>
This is our new user forum. This forum will be available to all users of the app, not just beta testers. So by asking your question here, you'll be helping future users with the same questions.
</p>

<h2>Tony G, Alpha Tester</h2>
<p>
    Before there was a beta test there was an alpha test. Long-time Lightning Bug user Tony G did a bang up job working with us to alpha test the app starting back in mid-July. He's also generously started documenting Ambio on a wiki that will be available here:
</p>
<blockquote><a href="http://ambio.wiki.happyexabytes.com/">http://ambio.wiki.happyexabytes.com/</a></blockquote>
<p>
    The wiki isn't quite ready yet, you could say it's also being beta tested, but it should be ready soon. This will eventually serve as Ambio's user guide. We'll keep you posted via the Google+ group.
</p>
<p>
    I can't thank Tony enough!
</p>

<h3>How do you become an Alpha tester?</h3>
<p>
    The short answer is: don't call us, we'll call you!
</p>
<p>
    In order to maintain productivity I keep the alpha team very small and specialized. It requires a lot of time and work and requires a level of technical expertise. The upside, of course: alpha testers get to play with the latest stable versions and content.
</p>
<p>
    If you're interested in joining the alpha team, the best advice I can give you is this: be an awesome beta tester :) … if and when we decide to add another member to the alpha team, I will contact you directly.
</p>

<h2>What happens after the beta is over?</h2>
<p>
    As long as you are a member of the Ambio Beta Google+ community you will always be an Ambio beta tester. For example, that means you'll have access to the Ambio 1.1 Beta (whenever and whatever that is). We might not have a beta for every release of the app, but when we do you'll get to be a part of it.
</p>
<p>
    That said, we've now officially started the 1.0 beta. The plan is for this beta to last 2-3 weeks at most. At that point we'll release the official 1.0 to the Play store and you will have two options:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Keep your beta version of Ambio installed to keep using (along with free content)</li>
    <li>Uninstall the beta, install to the official Play version (you'll have to re-install content, remake mixes)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    As far as I know, you can just keep the beta installed. But you won't be able to rate\comment the official Play app if you do. Because ratings are so critical to new apps, please consider installing the official 1.0 version. But after that, you can use whichever version you like.
</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>
    We'll be creating a Credits roll for Ambio at some point in the future that will include a Beta Testers section. I understand that many of you may prefer to keep your participation private, so please email <a href="mailto:support@happyexabytes.com">support@happyexabytes.com</a> and let us know you'd like to be included in the app's credits and how you'd like your name to appear!
</p>

<h2>And Without Further Ado...</h2>
<p>
    Ok, I'll shut my mouth now! 
</p>
<p>
    Open this link <em>from your Android device</em>:
</p>
<blockquote><a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.happyexabytes.ambio">https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.happyexabytes.ambio</a></blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>You will be presented with an Opt-In for the beta test</li>
    <li>Click the button that says "Become a Tester"</li>
    <li>The page will refresh and tell you "You are now a tester"</li>
    <li>At the bottom of the page, click "Download Ambio from the Play Store"</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Enjoy :)
